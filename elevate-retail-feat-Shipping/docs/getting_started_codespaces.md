# Getting Started with Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud IDE solution to help teams work on a project in an
isolated development environment without having to worry about managing concerns
for operating systems and dependencies.  
Put simply, this allows us to use VS Code in a web browser with no local setup
or changes required.  
[Codespaces Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
  
## Setup

1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the repository:
    - https://github.com/Cyber-Kaeh/elevate-retail

2. Click on the 
<a href="#" 
   style="display: inline-block; 
          padding: 8px 16px; 
          font-size: 16px; 
          font-weight: bold; 
          color: #fff; 
          background-color: #2ea44f; 
          border-radius: 6px; 
          text-decoration: none;">
   <span> < > Code &#9660; </span>
</a>
 button and then 'Open with Codespaces'

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Codespaces environment
    - It should recognize that there is a .devcontainer file already present and ask if you want to use that, click yes.  
  
## Working with Codespaces

It may take some time for the environment to fully load and set up on the first run, perhaps several minutes depending on internet connection. When you have access to your terminal at the bottom and don't see anything else loading you are ready to start coding!

Example terminal prompt when ready:
```bash
vscode âžœ /workspaces/ft_capstone/elevate-retail (main) $
```

## Next Steps

The .devcontainer file *should* also perform a `git pull` to ensure you are up to date with the current repository. If you don't see all the same files from the repository on the left or if you cannot start the Flask app, then it most likely did not automatically pull.  

That is ok though, because it is best practice to always make sure you are up to date every time you first sit down to code. I have outlined a brief Git crash course with the commands you should run the first time you start this project, along with every time you start a new coding session.  

Check out the crash course first, then head over to the instructions on how to start the project's web app.
